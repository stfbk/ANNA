# ACME

ACME (*Access Control Mechanisms Evaluator*) allows evaluating the performance of access control enforcement mechanisms (e.g., [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/), [XACML](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-os-en.html) and [CryptoAC](https://github.com/stfbk/CryptoAC)) through the **simulated execution of realistic workflows**. ACME is usually used in combination with [ACE](https://github.com/stfbk/ACE).

The design of ACME was firstly described in the (yet to be published) article "*A Simulation Framework for the Experimental Evaluation of Access Control Enforcement Mechanisms based on Business Processes*". Please see the [dedicated branch](https://github.com/stfbk/ACME/tree/A_Simulation_Framework_Replication_Package) for replicating the experiments presented in the article.

> **Important** - ACME is still experimental and under active development; we welcome your interest and really encourage you to reach out to the developers at `sberlato@fbk.eu` for more information on how to use ACME.
